# Import Cacao CSS into your project

We recommend that you import the Cacao modules after your site styles. This allows the Cacao styles to override site styles if necessary.

For example, the `.hidden` may need to override the `display` style of a component. It can't do that unless it's included after your site styles.

It's strongly recommended that you always include these imports:

- `@import 'cacao-css/dist/media.css';`
- `@import 'cacao-css/dist/reset.css';`
- `@import 'cacao-css/dist/base.css';`

Below is the full list of imports that you can use in your project.

<CodeBlock language="css" title="imports.css">{ImportsSource}</CodeBlock>;
