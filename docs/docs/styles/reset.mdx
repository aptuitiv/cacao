title: CSS reset
---

These styles add some minimal element style resets. It's inspired by [Josh Comeau's CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/).

These are almost always included in a project along with the [base styles](/styles/base) and the [media queries](/styles/media).

## How to import into your CSS

Import this into your CSS with:

```css
@import 'cacao-css/dist/reset.css';
```

Typically this is included above other styles.

See [Import Cacao CSS](/import) for more information.

## Source CSS

Below is the full source for the reset styles.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ImportsSource from '!!raw-loader!../../../dist/reset.css';

<CodeBlock language="css" title="reset.css">{ImportsSource}</CodeBlock>
