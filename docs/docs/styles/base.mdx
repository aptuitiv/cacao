The base styles provide reasonable defaults for some elements. These are almost always included in a project along with [reset](/styles/reset) and the [media queries](/styles/media).


## How to import into your CSS

Import this into your CSS with:

```css
@import 'cacao-css/dist/base.css';
```

Typically this is included above other styles.

See [Import Cacao CSS](/import) for more information.

## Source CSS

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ImportsSource from '!!raw-loader!../../../dist/base.css';

<CodeBlock language="css" title="base.css">{ImportsSource}</CodeBlock>
