title: Spacing
---

This provides styles for removing the space around an element when it's inside another element that has one of the spacing classes.

You can remove the top margin and padding from the first child within an element.

Or you can remove the bottom margin and padding from the last child within an element.

This is useful when you have an element that could contain user content, but you want to ensure the spacing within the element. For example, you want to ensure that a paragraph at the end will not have a bottom margin or padding.

## How to import into your CSS

Import this into your CSS with:

```css
@import 'cacao-css/dist/spacing/spacing.css';
```

See [Import Cacao CSS](/import) for more information.

## Example usage

Here is an example of using this remove the padding and margin from the first and last child in an element.

```html
<div class="first-child-st-0 last-child-sb-0">
    <h1>Content here</h1>

</div>
```

Here is an example where just the first child is affected.

```html
<div class="first-child-st-0 ">

</div>
