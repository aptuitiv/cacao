/**
 * Based on: https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid/
 *
 * Modifications:
 * - SASS.
 * - Apply relative positioning to columns in order to push/pull them.
 * - Only apply gutters to the left side to fix an issue where the negative
 *   margins can trigger a horizontal scrollbar if the component is as wide as
 *   the viewport.
