Arrange
=====

See: [https://github.com/suitcss/components-arrange](https://github.com/suitcss/components-arrange)

This component lets you lay out a row of cells in various ways. You can
specify whether a cell should be wide enough to fit its content, or take up
the remaining space in the row. It's also possible to give all cells an
equal width, and to control their vertical alignment.

### Settings

- `$arrange-gutter-size`
