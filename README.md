# Cacao

Cacao is a utility class CSS library. It intentionally does not provide styles for specific components. Rather, it has utility classes for doing common things like grids, setting heights and widths, and gutters.

> The `embed` style is the exception to that rule, but it only provides the minimal CSS to responsively embed an iframe.

## Installation

Install Cacao via NPM:

```bash
npm install cacao-css
```
